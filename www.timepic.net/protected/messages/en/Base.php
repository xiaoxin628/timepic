    'totoroCrossCalculatorArticle'=>'Thoughts to ponder while using the calculator: Calculations for crossing white, beige, velvet, violet, and sapphire mutations are based on what is generally accepted about the nature of those mutations. The resulting percentages are pretty straight-forward, but real life is not. Chins come in a much wider variety than shown here. Take the standard chinchilla, for example. They come in different shades of gray with various body shapes, fur qualities, and temperaments, which cannot be summed up in one animal alone. The same is true for mutation colors. Make sure you look at the complete package of your animals when planning your breedings, and don’t be afraid to stop by a chinchilla show, which is the best place to see and compare these different things all at once. While you can cross multiple mutations in the calculator to get some fun and interesting results, creating itty bitty chinnies is a serious business. Make good choices when you breed so that you can produce happy, healthy, pretty, fuzzy chins.

 

Any calculation involving ebony is treated a bit differently than the rest, since there likely many genotypes that produce the same and/or similar ebony coat colors. When making an ebony cross, bear in mind that the results will show a wider range of possibilities than you might actually encounter in any one particular breeding. The largest percentages will -usually- show you what you can most likely expect, but due to the inability to actually classify the genotypes of your breeding animals, you could still end up with some surprises. I would therefore keep very good records for each mating, keep an open mind and talk to other breeders who might have new and interesting things to say about their experiences, and see what your chins tell you through their offspring. Above all, strive to improve the overall health and quality (this is very good advice for any breeding, come to think of it). ',
